Description: # LifeHUD
        
        LifeHUD is a heads-up display for me to look at every morning when I get up. It includes
        integrations for my iCloud reminders, my Google calendar, and the current day's hourly
        weather forecast via the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev).
        
        ## Installation
        
        1. You may want to set up a virtualenv before you start.
        2. Copy `config.example.yaml` to `config.yaml` and fill out the fields with your keys.
        3.
            ```
            pip install -r requirements.txt
            python setup.py develop
            ```
        
        Now you can `pserve development.ini` and open up http://localhost:6543 to see the app.
